This is a weather forecast application using API.

The API used in this app is from "OpenWeatherMap" which is a weather database through which one can get different type of weather related information.

You can fetch the data in 2 ways:
1) Using City name
2) Using PINCODE

HOW TO GET WEATHER INFORMATION USING API:

----------------------------------------------

1) Search in your browser "OPENWEATHERMAP" OR Copy this url: https://openweathermap.org/

2) You will require to create an account on this site in order to fetch the data.

4) You can choose any of the api ( depending on the plan ).Here we are choosing Current Weather Data --> click on APIdoc -->you will find the api call link -->Copy that link and place it in the code(Line 11).

6)After these step you will able to fetch the weather data.


-- FOR BACKGROUND IMAGE:

You will need to place the weather.jpg in your project folder.

Let's break it down step by step:

1) Importing Libraries: The code imports the required libraries - tkinter for creating GUI elements, requests for making API requests, and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for working with images.

2) Getting Weather Data: There's a function called get_weather that is called when the "Get Weather Data" button is clicked. It takes the city name or pincode entered by the user and fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using an API key.

3) Displaying Weather Data: The weather data received from the API is displayed on the GUI. The temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind degree, and weather description are shown.

4) Creating GUI: The GUI elements are set up using labels, entry boxes, and buttons. The background image is displayed using a label. The user can input the city name or pincode in an entry box, and there's a button to fetch weather data.

5) Main Loop: The code enters the main loop with root.mainloop(), which keeps the GUI application running and handles user interactions.
